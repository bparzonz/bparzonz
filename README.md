### I Love Data!

I am a Business Analyst who is fascinated by the world of analytics. I believe data visualization is its own art form. Don't believe me? Just check out r/dataisbeautiful! Currently working towards my Masters in Business Analytics at UCLA Anderson.

Before graduate school, I worked in Cost for an Airforce contractor - a majority of my skillset having been applied towards ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile) program research. Aerospace is fascinating, and I am incredibly privileged to have learned from some of the most talented people supporting the U.S. government.

My toolset includes: 

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Ggplot2, Plotly, Automation, Web API integration) 
* R (Tidyverse, Ggplot2, Plotly)
* Microsoft Power BI (xViz, R Custom Visuals)
* Excel (Data Analysis, CO$TAT, Crystal Ball, VBA Macros)

Feel free to reach out!
